# projekt_wydzial_fizyki
In the project we had to analyse EEG and behavioral data - code in the repository is written by myself and was intended to be used by people who did not work with python before - that is why I tried to write code in simple way, often not optimal. 'EEG' script computes many things (it was easier to work with one file - comment particulary lines, changing parameters etc.)
